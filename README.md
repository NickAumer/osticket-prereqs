Download and install VC_redist and MySQL 5.5.62 from the installation files. 
**MySQL configuration**
- Typical Setup
- Post-install launch configuration wizard
- Standard Configuration
- Password 1

 Hit windows key and type in IIS, right-click and open as administrator. Go into the PHP manager and click Register new PHP and use the PHP directory we created earlier as the new PHP. Once that's done go back to the main IIS page and restart the server. Once restarted download osTicket from the installation folder. Extract via right click and this time we're going to go into the extracted directory and copy the upload folder to C:\initpub\wwwroot
 Once copied rename the upload folder to osTicket and restart the IIS server one more time. If done correctly you should see osTicket on the left panel of IIS under sites > default sites > osTicket. Select osTicket and then enter the PHP manager again, click â€œEnable or disable an extension" and enable the following 
 - php_imap.dll
 - php_intl.dll
 - php_opcache.dll

Now go to C:\inetpub\wwwroot\osTicket\include and rename ost-sampleconfig.php to ost-config.php
Change permissions to Allow Everyone > All


In IIS click osTicket under default sites and then on the right panel of IIS click browse :80 and click continue, this is where we will name it "Helpdesk,etc." and set the email for where customer e-mails will go.

The final download, download and install Heidi MySQL from the installation files. All thats left to do now is run MySQL and make a new session. Make sure you set the username and password of the session to match up to the MySQL Username and password settings in osTicket. Once the session is made make a new database via right-click and make sure this matches to what you set MySQL database in osTicket and click Install Now!

Assuming you had no errors you can use the following link to go to your help desk login http://localhost/osTicket/scp/login.php
and customers side would be http://localhost/osTicket/

For post-installation cleanup delete C:\inetpub\wwwroot\osTicket\setup
and set the C:\inetpub\wwwroot\osTicket\include\ost-config.php file to read-only permissions. That's it you've successfully installed osTicket.

## CONGRATS!
